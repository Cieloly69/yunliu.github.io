I am a Zorn Postdoctoral Fellow at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://math.indiana.edu/index.html). My mentor is [Ajay Ramadoss](https://math.indiana.edu/about/faculty/ramadoss-ajay.html). I received my Ph.D in Mathematics from [Cornell University](https://math.cornell.edu/) in July 2023, under the supervision of [Yuri Berest](https://math.cornell.edu/yuri-berest), and an M.S. in Computer Science from Cornell university in 2018.

My research interests lie in homotopy theory and representation theory. I spend quite some time on generalized equivariant cohomology theory of spaces equipped with compact Lie group actions,  and recently I am working on equivariant formal spaces and their relation with quasi-invariants. I am also interested in category theroy and higher categories, espeically functor homology, simplicial methods and their applications in algebeaic topology and derived algebraic geometry.
